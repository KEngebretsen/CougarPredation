This dataset describes the proportion of time that individual mountain lions (Puma concolor) spend displaying specific behaviors when foraging at their kill sites. For each independent foraging bout (independent visit to the kill site on camera), behaviors were coded in vigilance, feeding, caching, resting, unknown, and other. We calculated the proportion of time in each independent observation that the cougar spent engaging in the four focal behaviors as a response variable. Covariates that vary at the level of the kill-site or the observation are included.
